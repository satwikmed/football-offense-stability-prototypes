# QB–Receiver Stability Index

## Objective
Assess whether maintaining a quarterback’s primary receiving options is associated with year-over-year offensive stability during offseason transitions.

## Methodology
- Identified the top two pass catchers by targets (WR/TE) for each team-season.
- Created a *QB–Receiver Stability Index* based on how many of those top two targets returned in the following season (0, 1, or 2).
- Compared stability levels to year-over-year changes in offensive EPA per play.
- Used simulated data to prototype the framework and emphasize clarity and interpretability over prediction.

## Key Insight
Offenses retaining both primary targets tend to show tighter performance distributions, while teams replacing both top options experience greater variability, including increased downside risk.

## Use Case
This framework provides a simple offseason lens for evaluating continuity of primary passing relationships when assessing roster churn, extensions, or scheme transitions.
