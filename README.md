# Offseason Offensive Continuity Prototypes

This repository contains small prototype analyses exploring how offensive continuity relates to year-over-year stability in performance.  
The projects use **simulated data** to demonstrate framing, definitions, and interpretation rather than to replicate real NFL outcomes.

The focus is on:
- Offseason decision thinking
- Interpretability over complexity
- Risk and volatility management, not prediction
