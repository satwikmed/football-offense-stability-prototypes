# Pass-Catcher Continuity and Offensive Stability

## Objective
Explore whether retaining the same pass catchers year-over-year is associated with more stable offensive performance during the offseason transition.

## Methodology
- Defined *pass-catcher continuity* as the share of a team’s targets in season N that went to players who were on the same team in season N−1.
- Measured offensive stability as the year-over-year change in offensive EPA per play.
- Used simulated data to prototype the framework and focus on definition, logic, and interpretation rather than replicating real NFL outcomes.

## Key Insight
High continuity does not guarantee offensive improvement, but it is associated with reduced downside volatility. Teams with low continuity exhibit a wider range of outcomes, including sharper offensive regression.

## Use Case
This framework is intended as an offseason risk-management lens to inform decisions around roster churn, contract extensions, and tolerance for offensive volatility.
